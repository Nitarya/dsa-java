// Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of input increases.....

O(1):Constant time complexity
O(log n):Logarithmic time complexity
O(n):Linear time complexity
O(nlogn):Lineariyhmic time complexity
O(n^2):Quadratic time complexity
O(2^n):Exponential time complexity
